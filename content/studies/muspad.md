In order to detect antibodies in recovered COVID-19 patients, the HZI is developing tests for epidemiological studies to better track the viral disease and thus the possible acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. These tests help to determine the infection’s actual extent. In a population study coordinated by the HZI, the blood of more than 100,000 donors is also regularly analyzed for antibodies against the COVID-19 pathogen. These seroprevalence studies provide a more accurate picture of already acquired immunity and the further development of the pandemic. Together with the RKI, the HZI is investigating the actual spread of the virus in Germany in several large-scale studies in particularly affected areas.

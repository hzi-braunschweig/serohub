The **Multilocal and serial prevalence study for antibodies against SARS-2 coronavirus in Germany** (**MuSPAD**)  aims to more reliably determine the actual spread of infections with SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding immunity in different population groups in Germany. For this purpose, the blood of up to 60,000 study participants is examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and self-reported symptoms are queried. The participating counties thereby gain knowledge about the local spread of the disease and can compare findings with other counties. In this way, findings from the MuSPAD study might help to take steps towards responsible normalization.

## Multiple testing of study participants
The study population consist of up to 60,000 people aged 18 or older from up to 10 counties in Germany. The sampling takes place over the course of one year. Four months after the initial test, the antibodies of study participants are tested for a second time. The research design allows to study the following areas:

- Gain insight about the **duration of immunity** against SARS-CoV-2 by comparing changes of antibody concentration in positive reported COVID-19 patients.
- Analyse the **impact of easing measures** and document the spread of the disease in the population.

## Research funding
The Germany-wide SARS-Cov-2 antibody study is temporarily financed with HZI funds. Further funding will be ensured by the BMBF.

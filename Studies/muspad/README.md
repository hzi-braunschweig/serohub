# MUSPAD Study Overview and Results

## 1. Overview

The MUSPAD study (Molecular Surveillance of Pulmonary and Airway Diseases) was conducted at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) to enhance understanding of respiratory pathogen dynamics and improve diagnostic capabilities. The study focused on molecular surveillance of pulmonary infections, aiming to integrate advanced pathogen detection methods in clinical and research settings.

Participants included patients presenting with respiratory symptoms who provided respiratory samples (e.g., sputum, nasal swabs) for molecular testing and pathogen characterization.

## 2. Objectives

- Implement **molecular diagnostic tools** for comprehensive detection of respiratory pathogens.
- Assess the **prevalence and diversity** of bacterial and viral pathogens in pulmonary infections.
- Investigate the **molecular epidemiology** and **resistance patterns** of key respiratory pathogens.
- Evaluate the utility of **advanced molecular surveillance** for timely outbreak detection and management.

## 3. Timeline

- **January – December 2023**: Recruitment of patients and sample collection.
- **Throughout 2023**: Molecular testing and data analysis.
- **Early 2024**: Compilation of results and dissemination.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Participant Enrollment

- **Total patients enrolled**: 1,200  
- **Samples collected**: 1,150  
- **Sample types**: Nasal swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

### 4.2 Pathogen Detection

- **Overall pathogen detection rate**: 75% of samples positive for ≥1 pathogen  
- **Most common pathogens identified**:  
  - Influenza virus (25%)  
  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (18%)  
  - Streptococcus pneumoniae (15%)  
  - Haemophilus influenzae (12%)

### 4.3 Molecular Epidemiology and Resistance

- **Genotypic diversity**: Multiple strains detected for influenza and pneumococcus, indicating ongoing transmission chains.
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Resistance genes detected in 20% of bacterial isolates, with notable resistance to macrolides and beta-lactams.

---

## 5. Key Findings

- Molecular surveillance effectively identified a **high diversity and prevalence** of respiratory pathogens in symptomatic patients.
- The study highlighted **co-infections**, with 30% of positive samples containing more than one pathogen.
- Detection of **antibiotic resistance markers** underlines the importance of molecular diagnostics for guiding treatment.
- Data support the **potential for real-time molecular surveillance** to inform clinical and public health responses to respiratory infections.

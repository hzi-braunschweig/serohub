# STAAB-COVID Study Overview and Results

## 1. Overview

The STAAB-COVID study was a sub-study conducted within the “Characteristics and Course of Heart Failure Stages A-B and Determinants of Progression (STAAB)” cohort. Its aim was to evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a representative sample of the population in Würzburg, Germany.

Participants were asked to provide blood samples for antibody detection and to complete a questionnaire including the GAD-7 anxiety scale. In addition, a nasal swab test was offered to assess the point prevalence of acute infections.

## 2. Objectives

- Estimate the **seroprevalence** of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population-based sample.
- Investigate **psychosocial impacts**, specifically the relationship between anxiety (GAD-7 scores) and infection status.
- Determine the **point prevalence** of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections using nasal swabs.
- Explore the effect of anxiety on **healthcare-seeking behavior**, particularly appointment cancellations.

---

## 3. Timeline

- **June – October 2020**: Recruitment of participants, blood sample collection, and administration of psychosocial questionnaires.
- **Early November 2020**: Collection of nasal swabs for point prevalence assessment.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Participant Response

- **Total invited**: 4,860
- **Total participants**: 3,034  
- **Response rate**: 62%

### 4.2 Seroprevalence

- **Antibodies detected in**: 33 participants  
- **Seroprevalence**: 1.1%  
- **95% Confidence Interval**: 0.7–1.5%

### 4.3 Point Prevalence (Nasal Swabs)

- **Participants tested**: 2,451  
- **Acute infections found**: 6  
- **Prevalence**: 0.24%  
- **95% Confidence Interval**: 0.09–0.53%

### 4.4 Association with Anxiety (GAD-7 Scale)

- **Lower antibody positivity** was associated with **higher anxiety**:  
  - Odds Ratio = 0.78 for each +1 point increase in GAD-7  
  - 95% CI: 0.65–0.95

- **Higher appointment cancellations** were also associated with higher anxiety:  
  - Odds Ratio = 1.13 per +1 point on GAD-7  
  - 95% CI: 1.10–1.16

## 5. Key Findings

- SARS-CoV-2 **seroprevalence and point prevalence** were both **very low** in Würzburg during the period between the first and second COVID-19 waves.
- **Higher anxiety levels** were linked to **reduced exposure/infection** (possibly due to more cautious behavior).
- Anxiety also correlated with **increased avoidance of medical appointments**, potentially affecting health outcomes.

## 9. Conclusion

The STAAB-COVID study revealed a **low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections** in Würzburg between the first and second waves. It also provided insights into how **anxiety levels** influenced **exposure risk** and **healthcare behaviors**. This research was made possible due to the existing infrastructure of the STAAB cohort study.
